                    1&#39;,\n &#39;  From fairest creatures we desire increase,&#39;,\n &#34;  That thereby beauty&#39;s rose might never die,&#34;,\n &#39;  But as the riper should by time decease,&#39;,\n &#39;  His tender heir might bear his memory:&#39;,\n &#39;  But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,&#39;,\n &#34;  Feed&#39;st thy light&#39;s flame with self-substantial fuel,&#34;,\n &#39;  Making a famine where abundance lies,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:&#39;,\n &#34;  Thou that art now the world&#39;s fresh ornament,&#34;,\n &#39;  And only herald to the gaudy spring,&#39;,\n &#39;  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,&#39;,\n &#34;  And tender churl mak&#39;st waste in niggarding:&#34;,\n &#39;    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,&#39;,\n &#34;    To eat the world&#39;s due, by the grave and thee.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     2&#39;,\n &#39;  When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,&#39;,\n &#34;  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty&#39;s field,&#34;,\n &#34;  Thy youth&#39;s proud livery so gazed on now,&#34;,\n &#39;  Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,&#39;,\n &#39;  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;&#39;,\n &#39;  To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,&#39;,\n &#39;  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.&#39;,\n &#34;  How much more praise deserved thy beauty&#39;s use,&#34;,\n &#34;  If thou couldst answer &#39;This fair child of mine&#34;,\n &#34;  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;  Proving his beauty by succession thine.&#39;,\n &#39;    This were to be new made when thou art old,&#39;,\n &#34;    And see thy blood warm when thou feel&#39;st it cold.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     3&#39;,\n &#39;  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Now is the time that face should form another,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.&#39;,\n &#39;  For where is she so fair whose uneared womb&#39;,\n &#39;  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?&#39;,\n &#39;  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of his self-love to stop posterity?&#39;,\n &#34;  Thou art thy mother&#39;s glass and she in thee&#34;,\n &#39;  Calls back the lovely April of her prime,&#39;,\n &#39;  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,&#39;,\n &#39;  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.&#39;,\n &#39;    But if thou live remembered not to be,&#39;,\n &#39;    Die single and thine image dies with thee.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     4&#39;,\n &#39;  Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,&#39;,\n &#34;  Upon thy self thy beauty&#39;s legacy?&#34;,\n &#34;  Nature&#39;s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,&#34;,\n &#39;  And being frank she lends to those are free:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,&#39;,\n &#39;  The bounteous largess given thee to give?&#39;,\n &#39;  Profitless usurer why dost thou use&#39;,\n &#39;  So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?&#39;,\n &#39;  For having traffic with thy self alone,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,&#39;,\n &#39;  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,&#39;,\n &#39;  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?&#39;,\n &#39;    Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,&#39;,\n &#34;    Which used lives th&#39; executor to be.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     5&#39;,\n &#39;  Those hours that with gentle work did frame&#39;,\n &#39;  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell&#39;,\n &#39;  Will play the tyrants to the very same,&#39;,\n &#39;  And that unfair which fairly doth excel:&#39;,\n &#39;  For never-resting time leads summer on&#39;,\n &#39;  To hideous winter and confounds him there,&#39;,\n &#39;  Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,&#39;,\n &#34;  Beauty o&#39;er-snowed and bareness every where:&#34;,\n &#34;  Then were not summer&#39;s distillation left&#34;,\n &#39;  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,&#39;,\n &#34;  Beauty&#39;s effect with beauty were bereft,&#34;,\n &#39;  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.&#39;,\n &#39;    But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,&#39;,\n &#39;    Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     6&#39;,\n &#34;  Then let not winter&#39;s ragged hand deface,&#34;,\n &#39;  In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:&#39;,\n &#39;  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,&#39;,\n &#34;  With beauty&#39;s treasure ere it be self-killed:&#34;,\n &#39;  That use is not forbidden usury,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;&#39;,\n &#34;  That&#39;s for thy self to breed another thee,&#34;,\n &#39;  Or ten times happier be it ten for one,&#39;,\n &#39;  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,&#39;,\n &#39;  If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,&#39;,\n &#39;  Leaving thee living in posterity?&#39;,\n &#39;    Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,&#39;,\n &#34;    To be death&#39;s conquest and make worms thine heir.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     7&#39;,\n &#39;  Lo in the orient when the gracious light&#39;,\n &#39;  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye&#39;,\n &#39;  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,&#39;,\n &#39;  Serving with looks his sacred majesty,&#39;,\n &#39;  And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,&#39;,\n &#39;  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,&#39;,\n &#39;  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,&#39;,\n &#39;  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:&#39;,\n &#39;  But when from highmost pitch with weary car,&#39;,\n &#39;  Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,&#39;,\n &#39;  The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are&#39;,\n &#39;  From his low tract and look another way:&#39;,\n &#39;    So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:&#39;,\n &#39;    Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     8&#39;,\n &#34;  Music to hear, why hear&#39;st thou music sadly?&#34;,\n &#39;  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:&#39;,\n &#34;  Why lov&#39;st thou that which thou receiv&#39;st not gladly,&#34;,\n &#34;  Or else receiv&#39;st with pleasure thine annoy?&#34;,\n &#39;  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,&#39;,\n &#39;  By unions married do offend thine ear,&#39;,\n &#39;  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds&#39;,\n &#39;  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:&#39;,\n &#39;  Mark how one string sweet husband to another,&#39;,\n &#39;  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;&#39;,\n &#39;  Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:&#39;,\n &#39;    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,&#39;,\n &#34;    Sings this to thee, &#39;Thou single wilt prove none&#39;.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     9&#39;,\n &#34;  Is it for fear to wet a widow&#39;s eye,&#34;,\n &#34;  That thou consum&#39;st thy self in single life?&#34;,\n &#39;  Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,&#39;,\n &#39;  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,&#39;,\n &#39;  The world will be thy widow and still weep,&#39;,\n &#39;  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,&#39;,\n &#39;  When every private widow well may keep,&#39;,\n &#34;  By children&#39;s eyes, her husband&#39;s shape in mind:&#34;,\n &#39;  Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend&#39;,\n &#39;  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;&#39;,\n &#34;  But beauty&#39;s waste hath in the world an end,&#34;,\n &#39;  And kept unused the user so destroys it:&#39;,\n &#39;    No love toward others in that bosom sits&#39;,\n &#34;    That on himself such murd&#39;rous shame commits.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     10&#39;,\n &#34;  For shame deny that thou bear&#39;st love to any&#34;,\n &#39;  Who for thy self art so unprovident.&#39;,\n &#39;  Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,&#39;,\n &#34;  But that thou none lov&#39;st is most evident:&#34;,\n &#34;  For thou art so possessed with murd&#39;rous hate,&#34;,\n &#34;  That &#39;gainst thy self thou stick&#39;st not to conspire,&#34;,\n &#39;  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate&#39;,\n &#39;  Which to repair should be thy chief desire:&#39;,\n &#39;  O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,&#39;,\n &#39;  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?&#39;,\n &#39;  Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,&#39;,\n &#39;    Make thee another self for love of me,&#39;,\n &#39;    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     11&#39;,\n &#34;  As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#39;  In one of thine, from that which thou departest,&#39;,\n &#34;  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#39;  Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,&#39;,\n &#39;  Without this folly, age, and cold decay,&#39;,\n &#39;  If all were minded so, the times should cease,&#39;,\n &#39;  And threescore year would make the world away:&#39;,\n &#39;  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,&#39;,\n &#39;  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:&#39;,\n &#39;  Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;&#39;,\n &#39;  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:&#39;,\n &#39;    She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,&#39;,\n &#39;    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     12&#39;,\n &#39;  When I do count the clock that tells the time,&#39;,\n &#39;  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,&#39;,\n &#39;  When I behold the violet past prime,&#39;,\n &#34;  And sable curls all silvered o&#39;er with white:&#34;,\n &#39;  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd&#39;,\n &#34;  And summer&#39;s green all girded up in sheaves&#34;,\n &#39;  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then of thy beauty do I question make&#39;,\n &#39;  That thou among the wastes of time must go,&#39;,\n &#39;  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,&#39;,\n &#39;  And die as fast as they see others grow,&#39;,\n &#34;    And nothing &#39;gainst Time&#39;s scythe can make defence&#34;,\n &#39;    Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     13&#39;,\n &#39;  O that you were your self, but love you are&#39;,\n &#39;  No longer yours, than you your self here live,&#39;,\n &#39;  Against this coming end you should prepare,&#39;,\n &#39;  And your sweet semblance to some other give.&#39;,\n &#39;  So should that beauty which you hold in lease&#39;,\n &#39;  Find no determination, then you were&#39;,\n &#34;  Your self again after your self&#39;s decease,&#34;,\n &#39;  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.&#39;,\n &#39;  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,&#39;,\n &#34;  Against the stormy gusts of winter&#39;s day&#34;,\n &#34;  And barren rage of death&#39;s eternal cold?&#34;,\n &#39;    O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,&#39;,\n &#39;    You had a father, let your son say so.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     14&#39;,\n &#39;  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,&#39;,\n &#39;  And yet methinks I have astronomy,&#39;,\n &#39;  But not to tell of good, or evil luck,&#39;,\n &#34;  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons&#39; quality,&#34;,\n &#39;  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;&#39;,\n &#39;  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or say with princes if it shall go well&#39;,\n &#39;  By oft predict that I in heaven find.&#39;,\n &#39;  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,&#39;,\n &#39;  And constant stars in them I read such art&#39;,\n &#39;  As truth and beauty shall together thrive&#39;,\n &#39;  If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:&#39;,\n &#39;    Or else of thee this I prognosticate,&#39;,\n &#34;    Thy end is truth&#39;s and beauty&#39;s doom and date.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     15&#39;,\n &#39;  When I consider every thing that grows&#39;,\n &#39;  Holds in perfection but a little moment.&#39;,\n &#39;  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows&#39;,\n &#39;  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.&#39;,\n &#39;  When I perceive that men as plants increase,&#39;,\n &#39;  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:&#39;,\n &#39;  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,&#39;,\n &#39;  And wear their brave state out of memory.&#39;,\n &#39;  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,&#39;,\n &#39;  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,&#39;,\n &#39;  Where wasteful time debateth with decay&#39;,\n &#39;  To change your day of youth to sullied night,&#39;,\n &#39;    And all in war with Time for love of you,&#39;,\n &#39;    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     16&#39;,\n &#39;  But wherefore do not you a mightier way&#39;,\n &#39;  Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?&#39;,\n &#39;  And fortify your self in your decay&#39;,\n &#39;  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?&#39;,\n &#39;  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,&#39;,\n &#39;  And many maiden gardens yet unset,&#39;,\n &#39;  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,&#39;,\n &#39;  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:&#39;,\n &#39;  So should the lines of life that life repair&#39;,\n &#34;  Which this (Time&#39;s pencil) or my pupil pen&#34;,\n &#39;  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair&#39;,\n &#39;  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.&#39;,\n &#39;    To give away your self, keeps your self still,&#39;,\n &#39;    And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     17&#39;,\n &#39;  Who will believe my verse in time to come&#39;,\n &#39;  If it were filled with your most high deserts?&#39;,\n &#39;  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb&#39;,\n &#39;  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:&#39;,\n &#39;  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,&#39;,\n &#39;  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,&#39;,\n &#39;  The age to come would say this poet lies,&#39;,\n &#34;  Such heavenly touches ne&#39;er touched earthly faces.&#34;,\n &#39;  So should my papers (yellowed with their age)&#39;,\n &#39;  Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,&#39;,\n &#34;  And your true rights be termed a poet&#39;s rage,&#34;,\n &#39;  And stretched metre of an antique song.&#39;,\n &#39;    But were some child of yours alive that time,&#39;,\n &#39;    You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     18&#39;,\n &#34;  Shall I compare thee to a summer&#39;s day?&#34;,\n &#39;  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:&#39;,\n &#39;  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,&#39;,\n &#34;  And summer&#39;s lease hath all too short a date:&#34;,\n &#39;  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,&#39;,\n &#39;  And often is his gold complexion dimmed,&#39;,\n &#39;  And every fair from fair sometime declines,&#39;,\n &#34;  By chance, or nature&#39;s changing course untrimmed:&#34;,\n &#39;  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,&#39;,\n &#34;  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#34;  Nor shall death brag thou wand&#39;rest in his shade,&#34;,\n &#34;  When in eternal lines to time thou grow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#39;    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,&#39;,\n &#39;    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     19&#39;,\n &#34;  Devouring Time blunt thou the lion&#39;s paws,&#34;,\n &#39;  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,&#39;,\n &#34;  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger&#39;s jaws,&#34;,\n &#39;  And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,&#39;,\n &#34;  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#34;  And do whate&#39;er thou wilt swift-footed Time&#34;,\n &#39;  To the wide world and all her fading sweets:&#39;,\n &#39;  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,&#39;,\n &#34;  O carve not with thy hours my love&#39;s fair brow,&#34;,\n &#39;  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,&#39;,\n &#39;  Him in thy course untainted do allow,&#39;,\n &#34;  For beauty&#39;s pattern to succeeding men.&#34;,\n &#39;    Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,&#39;,\n &#39;    My love shall in my verse ever live young.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     20&#39;,\n &#34;  A woman&#39;s face with nature&#39;s own hand painted,&#34;,\n &#39;  Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,&#39;,\n &#34;  A woman&#39;s gentle heart but not acquainted&#34;,\n &#34;  With shifting change as is false women&#39;s fashion,&#34;,\n &#39;  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:&#39;,\n &#39;  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,&#39;,\n &#39;  A man in hue all hues in his controlling,&#39;,\n &#34;  Which steals men&#39;s eyes and women&#39;s souls amazeth.&#34;,\n &#39;  And for a woman wert thou first created,&#39;,\n &#39;  Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,&#39;,\n &#39;  And by addition me of thee defeated,&#39;,\n &#39;  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.&#39;,\n &#34;    But since she pricked thee out for women&#39;s pleasure,&#34;,\n &#34;    Mine be thy love and thy love&#39;s use their treasure.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     21&#39;,\n &#39;  So is it not with me as with that muse,&#39;,\n &#39;  Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,&#39;,\n &#39;  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,&#39;,\n &#39;  Making a couplement of proud compare&#39;,\n &#34;  With sun and moon, with earth and sea&#39;s rich gems:&#34;,\n &#34;  With April&#39;s first-born flowers and all things rare,&#34;,\n &#34;  That heaven&#39;s air in this huge rondure hems.&#34;,\n &#39;  O let me true in love but truly write,&#39;,\n &#39;  And then believe me, my love is as fair,&#39;,\n &#34;  As any mother&#39;s child, though not so bright&#34;,\n &#34;  As those gold candles fixed in heaven&#39;s air:&#34;,\n &#39;    Let them say more that like of hearsay well,&#39;,\n &#39;    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     22&#39;,\n &#39;  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,&#39;,\n &#39;  So long as youth and thou are of one date,&#39;,\n &#34;  But when in thee time&#39;s furrows I behold,&#34;,\n &#39;  Then look I death my days should expiate.&#39;,\n &#39;  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,&#39;,\n &#39;  How can I then be elder than thou art?&#39;,\n &#39;  O therefore love be of thyself so wary,&#39;,\n &#39;  As I not for my self, but for thee will,&#39;,\n &#39;  Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary&#39;,\n &#39;  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.&#39;,\n &#39;    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,&#39;,\n &#34;    Thou gav&#39;st me thine not to give back again.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     23&#39;,\n &#39;  As an unperfect actor on the stage,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who with his fear is put beside his part,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,&#39;,\n &#34;  Whose strength&#39;s abundance weakens his own heart;&#34;,\n &#39;  So I for fear of trust, forget to say,&#39;,\n &#34;  The perfect ceremony of love&#39;s rite,&#34;,\n &#34;  And in mine own love&#39;s strength seem to decay,&#34;,\n &#34;  O&#39;ercharged with burthen of mine own love&#39;s might:&#34;,\n &#39;  O let my looks be then the eloquence,&#39;,\n &#39;  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,&#39;,\n &#39;  More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.&#39;,\n &#39;    O learn to read what silent love hath writ,&#39;,\n &#34;    To hear with eyes belongs to love&#39;s fine wit.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     24&#39;,\n &#39;  Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,&#39;,\n &#34;  Thy beauty&#39;s form in table of my heart,&#34;,\n &#34;  My body is the frame wherein &#39;tis held,&#34;,\n &#34;  And perspective it is best painter&#39;s art.&#34;,\n &#39;  For through the painter must you see his skill,&#39;,\n &#39;  To find where your true image pictured lies,&#39;,\n &#34;  Which in my bosom&#39;s shop is hanging still,&#34;,\n &#39;  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:&#39;,\n &#39;  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,&#39;,\n &#39;  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me&#39;,\n &#39;  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun&#39;,\n &#39;  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;&#39;,\n &#39;    Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,&#39;,\n &#39;    They draw but what they see, know not the heart.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     25&#39;,\n &#39;  Let those who are in favour with their stars,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of public honour and proud titles boast,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars&#39;,\n &#39;  Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;&#39;,\n &#34;  Great princes&#39; favourites their fair leaves spread,&#34;,\n &#34;  But as the marigold at the sun&#39;s eye,&#34;,\n &#39;  And in themselves their pride lies buried,&#39;,\n &#39;  For at a frown they in their glory die.&#39;,\n &#39;  The painful warrior famoused for fight,&#39;,\n &#39;  After a thousand victories once foiled,&#39;,\n &#39;  Is from the book of honour razed quite,&#39;,\n &#39;  And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:&#39;,\n &#39;    Then happy I that love and am beloved&#39;,\n &#39;    Where I may not remove nor be removed.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     26&#39;,\n &#39;  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;&#39;,\n &#39;  To thee I send this written embassage&#39;,\n &#39;  To witness duty, not to show my wit.&#39;,\n &#39;  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine&#39;,\n &#39;  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;&#39;,\n &#39;  But that I hope some good conceit of thine&#39;,\n &#34;  In thy soul&#39;s thought (all naked) will bestow it:&#34;,\n &#39;  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,&#39;,\n &#39;  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,&#39;,\n &#39;  And puts apparel on my tattered loving,&#39;,\n &#39;  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,&#39;,\n &#39;    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     27&#39;,\n &#39;  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,&#39;,\n &#39;  The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,&#39;,\n &#39;  But then begins a journey in my head&#39;,\n &#34;  To work my mind, when body&#39;s work&#39;s expired.&#34;,\n &#39;  For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)&#39;,\n &#39;  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,&#39;,\n &#39;  Looking on darkness which the blind do see.&#39;,\n &#34;  Save that my soul&#39;s imaginary sight&#34;,\n &#39;  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)&#39;,\n &#39;  Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.&#39;,\n &#39;    Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,&#39;,\n &#39;    For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     28&#39;,\n &#39;  How can I then return in happy plight&#39;,\n &#39;  That am debarred the benefit of rest?&#39;,\n &#34;  When day&#39;s oppression is not eased by night,&#34;,\n &#39;  But day by night and night by day oppressed.&#39;,\n &#34;  And each (though enemies to either&#39;s reign)&#34;,\n &#39;  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,&#39;,\n &#39;  The one by toil, the other to complain&#39;,\n &#39;  How far I toil, still farther off from thee.&#39;,\n &#39;  I tell the day to please him thou art bright,&#39;,\n &#39;  And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:&#39;,\n &#39;  So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,&#39;,\n &#34;  When sparkling stars twire not thou gild&#39;st the even.&#34;,\n &#39;    But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,&#39;,\n &#34;    And night doth nightly make grief&#39;s length seem stronger&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     29&#39;,\n &#34;  When in disgrace with Fortune and men&#39;s eyes,&#34;,\n &#39;  I all alone beweep my outcast state,&#39;,\n &#39;  And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,&#39;,\n &#39;  And look upon my self and curse my fate,&#39;,\n &#39;  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,&#39;,\n &#39;  Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,&#39;,\n &#34;  Desiring this man&#39;s art, and that man&#39;s scope,&#34;,\n &#39;  With what I most enjoy contented least,&#39;,\n &#39;  Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,&#39;,\n &#39;  Haply I think on thee, and then my state,&#39;,\n &#39;  (Like to the lark at break of day arising&#39;,\n &#34;  From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven&#39;s gate,&#34;,\n &#39;    For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,&#39;,\n &#39;    That then I scorn to change my state with kings.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     30&#39;,\n &#39;  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,&#39;,\n &#39;  I summon up remembrance of things past,&#39;,\n &#39;  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,&#39;,\n &#34;  And with old woes new wail my dear time&#39;s waste:&#34;,\n &#39;  Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)&#39;,\n &#34;  For precious friends hid in death&#39;s dateless night,&#34;,\n &#34;  And weep afresh love&#39;s long since cancelled woe,&#34;,\n &#34;  And moan th&#39; expense of many a vanished sight.&#34;,\n &#39;  Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,&#39;,\n &#34;  And heavily from woe to woe tell o&#39;er&#34;,\n &#39;  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which I new pay as if not paid before.&#39;,\n &#39;    But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)&#39;,\n &#39;    All losses are restored, and sorrows end.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     31&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which I by lacking have supposed dead,&#39;,\n &#34;  And there reigns love and all love&#39;s loving parts,&#34;,\n &#39;  And all those friends which I thought buried.&#39;,\n &#39;  How many a holy and obsequious tear&#39;,\n &#34;  Hath dear religious love stol&#39;n from mine eye,&#34;,\n &#39;  As interest of the dead, which now appear,&#39;,\n &#39;  But things removed that hidden in thee lie.&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,&#39;,\n &#39;  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,&#39;,\n &#39;  That due of many, now is thine alone.&#39;,\n &#39;    Their images I loved, I view in thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     32&#39;,\n &#39;  If thou survive my well-contented day,&#39;,\n &#39;  When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover&#39;,\n &#39;  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey&#39;,\n &#39;  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:&#39;,\n &#34;  Compare them with the bett&#39;ring of the time,&#34;,\n &#39;  And though they be outstripped by every pen,&#39;,\n &#39;  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,&#39;,\n &#39;  Exceeded by the height of happier men.&#39;,\n &#39;  O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,&#39;,\n &#34;  &#39;Had my friend&#39;s Muse grown with this growing age,&#34;,\n &#39;  A dearer birth than this his love had brought&#39;,\n &#39;  To march in ranks of better equipage:&#39;,\n &#39;    But since he died and poets better prove,&#39;,\n &#34;    Theirs for their style I&#39;ll read, his for his love&#39;.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     33&#39;,\n &#39;  Full many a glorious morning have I seen,&#39;,\n &#39;  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,&#39;,\n &#39;  Kissing with golden face the meadows green;&#39;,\n &#39;  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:&#39;,\n &#39;  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,&#39;,\n &#39;  With ugly rack on his celestial face,&#39;,\n &#39;  And from the forlorn world his visage hide&#39;,\n &#39;  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:&#39;,\n &#39;  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,&#39;,\n &#39;  With all triumphant splendour on my brow,&#39;,\n &#39;  But out alack, he was but one hour mine,&#39;,\n &#39;  The region cloud hath masked him from me now.&#39;,\n &#39;    Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,&#39;,\n &#34;    Suns of the world may stain, when heaven&#39;s sun staineth.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     34&#39;,\n &#39;  Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,&#39;,\n &#39;  And make me travel forth without my cloak,&#39;,\n &#34;  To let base clouds o&#39;ertake me in my way,&#34;,\n &#34;  Hiding thy brav&#39;ry in their rotten smoke?&#34;,\n &#34;  &#39;Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,&#34;,\n &#39;  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,&#39;,\n &#39;  For no man well of such a salve can speak,&#39;,\n &#39;  That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,&#39;,\n &#39;  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,&#39;,\n &#34;  Th&#39; offender&#39;s sorrow lends but weak relief&#34;,\n &#34;  To him that bears the strong offence&#39;s cross.&#34;,\n &#39;    Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,&#39;,\n &#39;    And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     35&#39;,\n &#39;  No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,&#39;,\n &#39;  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,&#39;,\n &#39;  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,&#39;,\n &#39;  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.&#39;,\n &#39;  All men make faults, and even I in this,&#39;,\n &#39;  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,&#39;,\n &#39;  My self corrupting salving thy amiss,&#39;,\n &#39;  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:&#39;,\n &#39;  For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,&#39;,\n &#34;  And &#39;gainst my self a lawful plea commence:&#34;,\n &#39;  Such civil war is in my love and hate,&#39;,\n &#39;    That I an accessary needs must be,&#39;,\n &#39;    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     36&#39;,\n &#39;  Let me confess that we two must be twain,&#39;,\n &#39;  Although our undivided loves are one:&#39;,\n &#39;  So shall those blots that do with me remain,&#39;,\n &#39;  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.&#39;,\n &#39;  In our two loves there is but one respect,&#39;,\n &#39;  Though in our lives a separable spite,&#39;,\n &#34;  Which though it alter not love&#39;s sole effect,&#34;,\n &#34;  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love&#39;s delight.&#34;,\n &#39;  I may not evermore acknowledge thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,&#39;,\n &#39;  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:&#39;,\n &#39;    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,&#39;,\n &#39;    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     37&#39;,\n &#39;  As a decrepit father takes delight,&#39;,\n &#39;  To see his active child do deeds of youth,&#39;,\n &#34;  So I, made lame by Fortune&#39;s dearest spite&#34;,\n &#39;  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.&#39;,\n &#39;  For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or any of these all, or all, or more&#39;,\n &#39;  Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,&#39;,\n &#39;  I make my love engrafted to this store:&#39;,\n &#39;  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,&#39;,\n &#39;  That I in thy abundance am sufficed,&#39;,\n &#39;  And by a part of all thy glory live:&#39;,\n &#39;    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    This wish I have, then ten times happy me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     38&#39;,\n &#39;  How can my muse want subject to invent&#39;,\n &#34;  While thou dost breathe that pour&#39;st into my verse,&#34;,\n &#39;  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,&#39;,\n &#39;  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?&#39;,\n &#39;  O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,&#39;,\n &#39;  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,&#39;,\n &#34;  For who&#39;s so dumb that cannot write to thee,&#34;,\n &#39;  When thou thy self dost give invention light?&#39;,\n &#39;  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth&#39;,\n &#39;  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,&#39;,\n &#39;  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth&#39;,\n &#39;  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.&#39;,\n &#39;    If my slight muse do please these curious days,&#39;,\n &#39;    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     39&#39;,\n &#39;  O how thy worth with manners may I sing,&#39;,\n &#39;  When thou art all the better part of me?&#39;,\n &#39;  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:&#39;,\n &#34;  And what is&#39;t but mine own when I praise thee?&#34;,\n &#39;  Even for this, let us divided live,&#39;,\n &#39;  And our dear love lose name of single one,&#39;,\n &#39;  That by this separation I may give:&#39;,\n &#34;  That due to thee which thou deserv&#39;st alone:&#34;,\n &#39;  O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,&#39;,\n &#39;  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,&#39;,\n &#39;  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.&#39;,\n &#39;    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,&#39;,\n &#39;    By praising him here who doth hence remain.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     40&#39;,\n &#39;  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,&#39;,\n &#39;  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?&#39;,\n &#39;  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,&#39;,\n &#39;  All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,&#39;,\n &#39;  I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,&#39;,\n &#39;  But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest&#39;,\n &#39;  By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.&#39;,\n &#39;  I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief&#39;,\n &#39;  Although thou steal thee all my poverty:&#39;,\n &#39;  And yet love knows it is a greater grief&#39;,\n &#34;  To bear greater wrong, than hate&#39;s known injury.&#34;,\n &#39;    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,&#39;,\n &#39;    Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     41&#39;,\n &#39;  Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,&#39;,\n &#39;  When I am sometime absent from thy heart,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,&#39;,\n &#39;  For still temptation follows where thou art.&#39;,\n &#39;  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,&#39;,\n &#39;  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.&#39;,\n &#34;  And when a woman woos, what woman&#39;s son,&#34;,\n &#39;  Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?&#39;,\n &#39;  Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,&#39;,\n &#39;  And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who lead thee in their riot even there&#39;,\n &#39;  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:&#39;,\n &#39;    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    Thine by thy beauty being false to me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     42&#39;,\n &#39;  That thou hast her it is not all my grief,&#39;,\n &#39;  And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,&#39;,\n &#39;  That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,&#39;,\n &#39;  A loss in love that touches me more nearly.&#39;,\n &#39;  Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,&#39;,\n &#34;  Thou dost love her, because thou know&#39;st I love her,&#34;,\n &#39;  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,&#39;,\n &#34;  Suff&#39;ring my friend for my sake to approve her.&#34;,\n &#34;  If I lose thee, my loss is my love&#39;s gain,&#34;,\n &#39;  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,&#39;,\n &#39;  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,&#39;,\n &#39;  And both for my sake lay on me this cross,&#39;,\n &#34;    But here&#39;s the joy, my friend and I are one,&#34;,\n &#39;    Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     43&#39;,\n &#39;  When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,&#39;,\n &#39;  For all the day they view things unrespected,&#39;,\n &#39;  But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.&#39;,\n &#39;  Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright&#39;,\n &#34;  How would thy shadow&#39;s form, form happy show,&#34;,\n &#39;  To the clear day with thy much clearer light,&#39;,\n &#39;  When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!&#39;,\n &#39;  How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,&#39;,\n &#39;  By looking on thee in the living day,&#39;,\n &#39;  When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,&#39;,\n &#39;  Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!&#39;,\n &#39;    All days are nights to see till I see thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     44&#39;,\n &#39;  If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,&#39;,\n &#39;  Injurious distance should not stop my way,&#39;,\n &#39;  For then despite of space I would be brought,&#39;,\n &#39;  From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,&#39;,\n &#39;  No matter then although my foot did stand&#39;,\n &#39;  Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,&#39;,\n &#39;  As soon as think the place where he would be.&#39;,\n &#39;  But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought&#39;,\n &#39;  To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,&#39;,\n &#39;  But that so much of earth and water wrought,&#39;,\n &#34;  I must attend, time&#39;s leisure with my moan.&#34;,\n &#39;    Receiving nought by elements so slow,&#39;,\n &#34;    But heavy tears, badges of either&#39;s woe.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     45&#39;,\n &#39;  The other two, slight air, and purging fire,&#39;,\n &#39;  Are both with thee, wherever I abide,&#39;,\n &#39;  The first my thought, the other my desire,&#39;,\n &#39;  These present-absent with swift motion slide.&#39;,\n &#39;  For when these quicker elements are gone&#39;,\n &#39;  In tender embassy of love to thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  My life being made of four, with two alone,&#39;,\n &#39;  Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.&#39;,\n &#34;  Until life&#39;s composition be recured,&#34;,\n &#39;  By those swift messengers returned from thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who even but now come back again assured,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.&#39;,\n &#39;    This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,&#39;,\n &#39;    I send them back again and straight grow sad.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     46&#39;,\n &#39;  Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,&#39;,\n &#39;  How to divide the conquest of thy sight,&#39;,\n &#34;  Mine eye, my heart thy picture&#39;s sight would bar,&#34;,\n &#39;  My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,&#39;,\n &#39;  My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,&#39;,\n &#39;  (A closet never pierced with crystal eyes)&#39;,\n &#39;  But the defendant doth that plea deny,&#39;,\n &#39;  And says in him thy fair appearance lies.&#39;,\n &#39;  To side this title is impanelled&#39;,\n &#39;  A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,&#39;,\n &#39;  And by their verdict is determined&#39;,\n &#34;  The clear eye&#39;s moiety, and the dear heart&#39;s part.&#34;,\n &#34;    As thus, mine eye&#39;s due is thy outward part,&#34;,\n &#34;    And my heart&#39;s right, thy inward love of heart.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     47&#39;,\n &#39;  Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,&#39;,\n &#39;  And each doth good turns now unto the other,&#39;,\n &#39;  When that mine eye is famished for a look,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;&#39;,\n &#34;  With my love&#39;s picture then my eye doth feast,&#34;,\n &#39;  And to the painted banquet bids my heart:&#39;,\n &#34;  Another time mine eye is my heart&#39;s guest,&#34;,\n &#39;  And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.&#39;,\n &#39;  So either by thy picture or my love,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy self away, art present still with me,&#39;,\n &#39;  For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,&#39;,\n &#39;  And I am still with them, and they with thee.&#39;,\n &#39;    Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight&#39;,\n &#34;    Awakes my heart, to heart&#39;s and eye&#39;s delight.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     48&#39;,\n &#39;  How careful was I when I took my way,&#39;,\n &#39;  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,&#39;,\n &#39;  That to my use it might unused stay&#39;,\n &#39;  From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!&#39;,\n &#39;  But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,&#39;,\n &#39;  Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,&#39;,\n &#39;  Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.&#39;,\n &#39;  Thee have I not locked up in any chest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,&#39;,\n &#39;  Within the gentle closure of my breast,&#39;,\n &#39;  From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,&#39;,\n &#34;    And even thence thou wilt be stol&#39;n I fear,&#34;,\n &#39;    For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     49&#39;,\n &#39;  Against that time (if ever that time come)&#39;,\n &#39;  When I shall see thee frown on my defects,&#39;,\n &#39;  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,&#39;,\n &#39;  Called to that audit by advised respects,&#39;,\n ...]</div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">Out[5]: [&#39;This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with&#39;,\n &#39;almost no restrictions whatsoever.

fairest creatures we desire increase,&#39;,\n &#34;  That thereby beauty&#39;s rose might never die,&#34;,\n &#39;  But as the riper should by time decease,&#39;,\n &#39;  His tender heir might bear his memory:&#39;,\n &#39;  But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,&#39;,\n &#34;  Feed&#39;st thy light&#39;s flame with self-substantial fuel,&#34;,\n &#39;  Making a famine where abundance lies,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:&#39;,\n &#34;  Thou that art now the world&#39;s fresh ornament,&#34;,\n &#39;  And only herald to the gaudy spring,&#39;,\n &#39;  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,&#39;,\n &#34;  And tender churl mak&#39;st waste in niggarding:&#34;,\n &#39;    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,&#39;,\n &#34;    To eat the world&#39;s due, by the grave and thee.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     2&#39;,\n &#39;  When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,&#39;,\n &#34;  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty&#39;s field,&#34;,\n &#34;  Thy youth&#39;s proud livery so gazed on now,&#34;,\n &#39;  Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,&#39;,\n &#39;  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;&#39;,\n &#39;  To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,&#39;,\n &#39;  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.&#39;,\n &#34;  How much more praise deserved thy beauty&#39;s use,&#34;,\n &#34;  If thou couldst answer &#39;This fair child of mine&#34;,\n &#34;  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;  Proving his beauty by succession thine.&#39;,\n &#39;    This were to be new made when thou art old,&#39;,\n &#34;    And see thy blood warm when thou feel&#39;st it cold.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     3&#39;,\n &#39;  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Now is the time that face should form another,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.&#39;,\n &#39;  For where is she so fair whose uneared womb&#39;,\n &#39;  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?&#39;,\n &#39;  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of his self-love to stop posterity?&#39;,\n &#34;  Thou art thy mother&#39;s glass and she in thee&#34;,\n &#39;  Calls back the lovely April of her prime,&#39;,\n &#39;  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,&#39;,\n &#39;  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.&#39;,\n &#39;    But if thou live remembered not to be,&#39;,\n &#39;    Die single and thine image dies with thee.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     4&#39;,\n &#39;  Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,&#39;,\n &#34;  Upon thy self thy beauty&#39;s legacy?&#34;,\n &#34;  Nature&#39;s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,&#34;,\n &#39;  And being frank she lends to those are free:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,&#39;,\n &#39;  The bounteous largess given thee to give?&#39;,\n &#39;  Profitless usurer why dost thou use&#39;,\n &#39;  So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?&#39;,\n &#39;  For having traffic with thy self alone,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,&#39;,\n &#39;  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,&#39;,\n &#39;  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?&#39;,\n &#39;    Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,&#39;,\n &#34;    Which used lives th&#39; executor to be.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     5&#39;,\n &#39;  Those hours that with gentle work did frame&#39;,\n &#39;  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell&#39;,\n &#39;  Will play the tyrants to the very same,&#39;,\n &#39;  And that unfair which fairly doth excel:&#39;,\n &#39;  For never-resting time leads summer on&#39;,\n &#39;  To hideous winter and confounds him there,&#39;,\n &#39;  Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,&#39;,\n &#34;  Beauty o&#39;er-snowed and bareness every where:&#34;,\n &#34;  Then were not summer&#39;s distillation left&#34;,\n &#39;  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,&#39;,\n &#34;  Beauty&#39;s effect with beauty were bereft,&#34;,\n &#39;  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.&#39;,\n &#39;    But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,&#39;,\n &#39;    Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     6&#39;,\n &#34;  Then let not winter&#39;s ragged hand deface,&#34;,\n &#39;  In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:&#39;,\n &#39;  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,&#39;,\n &#34;  With beauty&#39;s treasure ere it be self-killed:&#34;,\n &#39;  That use is not forbidden usury,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;&#39;,\n &#34;  That&#39;s for thy self to breed another thee,&#34;,\n &#39;  Or ten times happier be it ten for one,&#39;,\n &#39;  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,&#39;,\n &#39;  If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,&#39;,\n &#39;  Leaving thee living in posterity?&#39;,\n &#39;    Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,&#39;,\n &#34;    To be death&#39;s conquest and make worms thine heir.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     7&#39;,\n &#39;  Lo in the orient when the gracious light&#39;,\n &#39;  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye&#39;,\n &#39;  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,&#39;,\n &#39;  Serving with looks his sacred majesty,&#39;,\n &#39;  And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,&#39;,\n &#39;  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,&#39;,\n &#39;  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,&#39;,\n &#39;  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:&#39;,\n &#39;  But when from highmost pitch with weary car,&#39;,\n &#39;  Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,&#39;,\n &#39;  The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are&#39;,\n &#39;  From his low tract and look another way:&#39;,\n &#39;    So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:&#39;,\n &#39;    Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     8&#39;,\n &#34;  Music to hear, why hear&#39;st thou music sadly?&#34;,\n &#39;  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:&#39;,\n &#34;  Why lov&#39;st thou that which thou receiv&#39;st not gladly,&#34;,\n &#34;  Or else receiv&#39;st with pleasure thine annoy?&#34;,\n &#39;  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,&#39;,\n &#39;  By unions married do offend thine ear,&#39;,\n &#39;  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds&#39;,\n &#39;  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:&#39;,\n &#39;  Mark how one string sweet husband to another,&#39;,\n &#39;  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;&#39;,\n &#39;  Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:&#39;,\n &#39;    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,&#39;,\n &#34;    Sings this to thee, &#39;Thou single wilt prove none&#39;.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     9&#39;,\n &#34;  Is it for fear to wet a widow&#39;s eye,&#34;,\n &#34;  That thou consum&#39;st thy self in single life?&#34;,\n &#39;  Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,&#39;,\n &#39;  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,&#39;,\n &#39;  The world will be thy widow and still weep,&#39;,\n &#39;  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,&#39;,\n &#39;  When every private widow well may keep,&#39;,\n &#34;  By children&#39;s eyes, her husband&#39;s shape in mind:&#34;,\n &#39;  Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend&#39;,\n &#39;  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;&#39;,\n &#34;  But beauty&#39;s waste hath in the world an end,&#34;,\n &#39;  And kept unused the user so destroys it:&#39;,\n &#39;    No love toward others in that bosom sits&#39;,\n &#34;    That on himself such murd&#39;rous shame commits.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     10&#39;,\n &#34;  For shame deny that thou bear&#39;st love to any&#34;,\n &#39;  Who for thy self art so unprovident.&#39;,\n &#39;  Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,&#39;,\n &#34;  But that thou none lov&#39;st is most evident:&#34;,\n &#34;  For thou art so possessed with murd&#39;rous hate,&#34;,\n &#34;  That &#39;gainst thy self thou stick&#39;st not to conspire,&#34;,\n &#39;  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate&#39;,\n &#39;  Which to repair should be thy chief desire:&#39;,\n &#39;  O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,&#39;,\n &#39;  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?&#39;,\n &#39;  Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,&#39;,\n &#39;    Make thee another self for love of me,&#39;,\n &#39;    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     11&#39;,\n &#34;  As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#39;  In one of thine, from that which thou departest,&#39;,\n &#34;  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#39;  Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,&#39;,\n &#39;  Without this folly, age, and cold decay,&#39;,\n &#39;  If all were minded so, the times should cease,&#39;,\n &#39;  And threescore year would make the world away:&#39;,\n &#39;  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,&#39;,\n &#39;  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:&#39;,\n &#39;  Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;&#39;,\n &#39;  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:&#39;,\n &#39;    She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,&#39;,\n &#39;    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     12&#39;,\n &#39;  When I do count the clock that tells the time,&#39;,\n &#39;  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,&#39;,\n &#39;  When I behold the violet past prime,&#39;,\n &#34;  And sable curls all silvered o&#39;er with white:&#34;,\n &#39;  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd&#39;,\n &#34;  And summer&#39;s green all girded up in sheaves&#34;,\n &#39;  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then of thy beauty do I question make&#39;,\n &#39;  That thou among the wastes of time must go,&#39;,\n &#39;  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,&#39;,\n &#39;  And die as fast as they see others grow,&#39;,\n &#34;    And nothing &#39;gainst Time&#39;s scythe can make defence&#34;,\n &#39;    Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     13&#39;,\n &#39;  O that you were your self, but love you are&#39;,\n &#39;  No longer yours, than you your self here live,&#39;,\n &#39;  Against this coming end you should prepare,&#39;,\n &#39;  And your sweet semblance to some other give.&#39;,\n &#39;  So should that beauty which you hold in lease&#39;,\n &#39;  Find no determination, then you were&#39;,\n &#34;  Your self again after your self&#39;s decease,&#34;,\n &#39;  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.&#39;,\n &#39;  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,&#39;,\n &#34;  Against the stormy gusts of winter&#39;s day&#34;,\n &#34;  And barren rage of death&#39;s eternal cold?&#34;,\n &#39;    O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,&#39;,\n &#39;    You had a father, let your son say so.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     14&#39;,\n &#39;  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,&#39;,\n &#39;  And yet methinks I have astronomy,&#39;,\n &#39;  But not to tell of good, or evil luck,&#39;,\n &#34;  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons&#39; quality,&#34;,\n &#39;  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;&#39;,\n &#39;  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or say with princes if it shall go well&#39;,\n &#39;  By oft predict that I in heaven find.&#39;,\n &#39;  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,&#39;,\n &#39;  And constant stars in them I read such art&#39;,\n &#39;  As truth and beauty shall together thrive&#39;,\n &#39;  If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:&#39;,\n &#39;    Or else of thee this I prognosticate,&#39;,\n &#34;    Thy end is truth&#39;s and beauty&#39;s doom and date.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     15&#39;,\n &#39;  When I consider every thing that grows&#39;,\n &#39;  Holds in perfection but a little moment.&#39;,\n &#39;  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows&#39;,\n &#39;  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.&#39;,\n &#39;  When I perceive that men as plants increase,&#39;,\n &#39;  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:&#39;,\n &#39;  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,&#39;,\n &#39;  And wear their brave state out of memory.&#39;,\n &#39;  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,&#39;,\n &#39;  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,&#39;,\n &#39;  Where wasteful time debateth with decay&#39;,\n &#39;  To change your day of youth to sullied night,&#39;,\n &#39;    And all in war with Time for love of you,&#39;,\n &#39;    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     16&#39;,\n &#39;  But wherefore do not you a mightier way&#39;,\n &#39;  Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?&#39;,\n &#39;  And fortify your self in your decay&#39;,\n &#39;  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?&#39;,\n &#39;  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,&#39;,\n &#39;  And many maiden gardens yet unset,&#39;,\n &#39;  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,&#39;,\n &#39;  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:&#39;,\n &#39;  So should the lines of life that life repair&#39;,\n &#34;  Which this (Time&#39;s pencil) or my pupil pen&#34;,\n &#39;  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair&#39;,\n &#39;  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.&#39;,\n &#39;    To give away your self, keeps your self still,&#39;,\n &#39;    And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     17&#39;,\n &#39;  Who will believe my verse in time to come&#39;,\n &#39;  If it were filled with your most high deserts?&#39;,\n &#39;  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb&#39;,\n &#39;  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:&#39;,\n &#39;  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,&#39;,\n &#39;  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,&#39;,\n &#39;  The age to come would say this poet lies,&#39;,\n &#34;  Such heavenly touches ne&#39;er touched earthly faces.&#34;,\n &#39;  So should my papers (yellowed with their age)&#39;,\n &#39;  Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,&#39;,\n &#34;  And your true rights be termed a poet&#39;s rage,&#34;,\n &#39;  And stretched metre of an antique song.&#39;,\n &#39;    But were some child of yours alive that time,&#39;,\n &#39;    You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     18&#39;,\n &#34;  Shall I compare thee to a summer&#39;s day?&#34;,\n &#39;  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:&#39;,\n &#39;  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,&#39;,\n &#34;  And summer&#39;s lease hath all too short a date:&#34;,\n &#39;  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,&#39;,\n &#39;  And often is his gold complexion dimmed,&#39;,\n &#39;  And every fair from fair sometime declines,&#39;,\n &#34;  By chance, or nature&#39;s changing course untrimmed:&#34;,\n &#39;  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,&#39;,\n &#34;  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#34;  Nor shall death brag thou wand&#39;rest in his shade,&#34;,\n &#34;  When in eternal lines to time thou grow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#39;    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,&#39;,\n &#39;    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     19&#39;,\n &#34;  Devouring Time blunt thou the lion&#39;s paws,&#34;,\n &#39;  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,&#39;,\n &#34;  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger&#39;s jaws,&#34;,\n &#39;  And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,&#39;,\n &#34;  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#34;  And do whate&#39;er thou wilt swift-footed Time&#34;,\n &#39;  To the wide world and all her fading sweets:&#39;,\n &#39;  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,&#39;,\n &#34;  O carve not with thy hours my love&#39;s fair brow,&#34;,\n &#39;  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,&#39;,\n &#39;  Him in thy course untainted do allow,&#39;,\n &#34;  For beauty&#39;s pattern to succeeding men.&#34;,\n &#39;    Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,&#39;,\n &#39;    My love shall in my verse ever live young.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     20&#39;,\n &#34;  A woman&#39;s face with nature&#39;s own hand painted,&#34;,\n &#39;  Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,&#39;,\n &#34;  A woman&#39;s gentle heart but not acquainted&#34;,\n &#34;  With shifting change as is false women&#39;s fashion,&#34;,\n &#39;  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:&#39;,\n &#39;  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,&#39;,\n &#39;  A man in hue all hues in his controlling,&#39;,\n &#34;  Which steals men&#39;s eyes and women&#39;s souls amazeth.&#34;,\n &#39;  And for a woman wert thou first created,&#39;,\n &#39;  Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,&#39;,\n &#39;  And by addition me of thee defeated,&#39;,\n &#39;  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.&#39;,\n &#34;    But since she pricked thee out for women&#39;s pleasure,&#34;,\n &#34;    Mine be thy love and thy love&#39;s use their treasure.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     21&#39;,\n &#39;  So is it not with me as with that muse,&#39;,\n &#39;  Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,&#39;,\n &#39;  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,&#39;,\n &#39;  Making a couplement of proud compare&#39;,\n &#34;  With sun and moon, with earth and sea&#39;s rich gems:&#34;,\n &#34;  With April&#39;s first-born flowers and all things rare,&#34;,\n &#34;  That heaven&#39;s air in this huge rondure hems.&#34;,\n &#39;  O let me true in love but truly write,&#39;,\n &#39;  And then believe me, my love is as fair,&#39;,\n &#34;  As any mother&#39;s child, though not so bright&#34;,\n &#34;  As those gold candles fixed in heaven&#39;s air:&#34;,\n &#39;    Let them say more that like of hearsay well,&#39;,\n &#39;    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     22&#39;,\n &#39;  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,&#39;,\n &#39;  So long as youth and thou are of one date,&#39;,\n &#34;  But when in thee time&#39;s furrows I behold,&#34;,\n &#39;  Then look I death my days should expiate.&#39;,\n &#39;  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,&#39;,\n &#39;  How can I then be elder than thou art?&#39;,\n &#39;  O therefore love be of thyself so wary,&#39;,\n &#39;  As I not for my self, but for thee will,&#39;,\n &#39;  Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary&#39;,\n &#39;  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.&#39;,\n &#39;    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,&#39;,\n &#34;    Thou gav&#39;st me thine not to give back again.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     23&#39;,\n &#39;  As an unperfect actor on the stage,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who with his fear is put beside his part,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,&#39;,\n &#34;  Whose strength&#39;s abundance weakens his own heart;&#34;,\n &#39;  So I for fear of trust, forget to say,&#39;,\n &#34;  The perfect ceremony of love&#39;s rite,&#34;,\n &#34;  And in mine own love&#39;s strength seem to decay,&#34;,\n &#34;  O&#39;ercharged with burthen of mine own love&#39;s might:&#34;,\n &#39;  O let my looks be then the eloquence,&#39;,\n &#39;  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,&#39;,\n &#39;  More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.&#39;,\n &#39;    O learn to read what silent love hath writ,&#39;,\n &#34;    To hear with eyes belongs to love&#39;s fine wit.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     24&#39;,\n &#39;  Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,&#39;,\n &#34;  Thy beauty&#39;s form in table of my heart,&#34;,\n &#34;  My body is the frame wherein &#39;tis held,&#34;,\n &#34;  And perspective it is best painter&#39;s art.&#34;,\n &#39;  For through the painter must you see his skill,&#39;,\n &#39;  To find where your true image pictured lies,&#39;,\n &#34;  Which in my bosom&#39;s shop is hanging still,&#34;,\n &#39;  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:&#39;,\n &#39;  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,&#39;,\n &#39;  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me&#39;,\n &#39;  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun&#39;,\n &#39;  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;&#39;,\n &#39;    Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,&#39;,\n &#39;    They draw but what they see, know not the heart.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     25&#39;,\n &#39;  Let those who are in favour with their stars,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of public honour and proud titles boast,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars&#39;,\n &#39;  Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;&#39;,\n &#34;  Great princes&#39; favourites their fair leaves spread,&#34;,\n &#34;  But as the marigold at the sun&#39;s eye,&#34;,\n &#39;  And in themselves their pride lies buried,&#39;,\n &#39;  For at a frown they in their glory die.&#39;,\n &#39;  The painful warrior famoused for fight,&#39;,\n &#39;  After a thousand victories once foiled,&#39;,\n &#39;  Is from the book of honour razed quite,&#39;,\n &#39;  And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:&#39;,\n &#39;    Then happy I that love and am beloved&#39;,\n &#39;    Where I may not remove nor be removed.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     26&#39;,\n &#39;  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;&#39;,\n &#39;  To thee I send this written embassage&#39;,\n &#39;  To witness duty, not to show my wit.&#39;,\n &#39;  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine&#39;,\n &#39;  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;&#39;,\n &#39;  But that I hope some good conceit of thine&#39;,\n &#34;  In thy soul&#39;s thought (all naked) will bestow it:&#34;,\n &#39;  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,&#39;,\n &#39;  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,&#39;,\n &#39;  And puts apparel on my tattered loving,&#39;,\n &#39;  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,&#39;,\n &#39;    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     27&#39;,\n &#39;  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,&#39;,\n &#39;  The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,&#39;,\n &#39;  But then begins a journey in my head&#39;,\n &#34;  To work my mind, when body&#39;s work&#39;s expired.&#34;,\n &#39;  For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)&#39;,\n &#39;  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,&#39;,\n &#39;  Looking on darkness which the blind do see.&#39;,\n &#34;  Save that my soul&#39;s imaginary sight&#34;,\n &#39;  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)&#39;,\n &#39;  Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.&#39;,\n &#39;    Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,&#39;,\n &#39;    For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     28&#39;,\n &#39;  How can I then return in happy plight&#39;,\n &#39;  That am debarred the benefit of rest?&#39;,\n &#34;  When day&#39;s oppression is not eased by night,&#34;,\n &#39;  But day by night and night by day oppressed.&#39;,\n &#34;  And each (though enemies to either&#39;s reign)&#34;,\n &#39;  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,&#39;,\n &#39;  The one by toil, the other to complain&#39;,\n &#39;  How far I toil, still farther off from thee.&#39;,\n &#39;  I tell the day to please him thou art bright,&#39;,\n &#39;  And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:&#39;,\n &#39;  So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,&#39;,\n &#34;  When sparkling stars twire not thou gild&#39;st the even.&#34;,\n &#39;    But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,&#39;,\n &#34;    And night doth nightly make grief&#39;s length seem stronger&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     29&#39;,\n &#34;  When in disgrace with Fortune and men&#39;s eyes,&#34;,\n &#39;  I all alone beweep my outcast state,&#39;,\n &#39;  And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,&#39;,\n &#39;  And look upon my self and curse my fate,&#39;,\n &#39;  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,&#39;,\n &#39;  Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,&#39;,\n &#34;  Desiring this man&#39;s art, and that man&#39;s scope,&#34;,\n &#39;  With what I most enjoy contented least,&#39;,\n &#39;  Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,&#39;,\n &#39;  Haply I think on thee, and then my state,&#39;,\n &#39;  (Like to the lark at break of day arising&#39;,\n &#34;  From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven&#39;s gate,&#34;,\n &#39;    For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,&#39;,\n &#39;    That then I scorn to change my state with kings.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     30&#39;,\n &#39;  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,&#39;,\n &#39;  I summon up remembrance of things past,&#39;,\n &#39;  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,&#39;,\n &#34;  And with old woes new wail my dear time&#39;s waste:&#34;,\n &#39;  Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)&#39;,\n &#34;  For precious friends hid in death&#39;s dateless night,&#34;,\n &#34;  And weep afresh love&#39;s long since cancelled woe,&#34;,\n &#34;  And moan th&#39; expense of many a vanished sight.&#34;,\n &#39;  Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,&#39;,\n &#34;  And heavily from woe to woe tell o&#39;er&#34;,\n &#39;  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which I new pay as if not paid before.&#39;,\n &#39;    But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)&#39;,\n &#39;    All losses are restored, and sorrows end.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     31&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which I by lacking have supposed dead,&#39;,\n &#34;  And there reigns love and all love&#39;s loving parts,&#34;,\n &#39;  And all those friends which I thought buried.&#39;,\n &#39;  How many a holy and obsequious tear&#39;,\n &#34;  Hath dear religious love stol&#39;n from mine eye,&#34;,\n &#39;  As interest of the dead, which now appear,&#39;,\n &#39;  But things removed that hidden in thee lie.&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,&#39;,\n &#39;  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,&#39;,\n &#39;  That due of many, now is thine alone.&#39;,\n &#39;    Their images I loved, I view in thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     32&#39;,\n &#39;  If thou survive my well-contented day,&#39;,\n &#39;  When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover&#39;,\n &#39;  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey&#39;,\n &#39;  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:&#39;,\n &#34;  Compare them with the bett&#39;ring of the time,&#34;,\n &#39;  And though they be outstripped by every pen,&#39;,\n &#39;  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,&#39;,\n &#39;  Exceeded by the height of happier men.&#39;,\n &#39;  O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,&#39;,\n &#34;  &#39;Had my friend&#39;s Muse grown with this growing age,&#34;,\n &#39;  A dearer birth than this his love had brought&#39;,\n &#39;  To march in ranks of better equipage:&#39;,\n &#39;    But since he died and poets better prove,&#39;,\n &#34;    Theirs for their style I&#39;ll read, his for his love&#39;.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     33&#39;,\n &#39;  Full many a glorious morning have I seen,&#39;,\n &#39;  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,&#39;,\n &#39;  Kissing with golden face the meadows green;&#39;,\n &#39;  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:&#39;,\n &#39;  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,&#39;,\n &#39;  With ugly rack on his celestial face,&#39;,\n &#39;  And from the forlorn world his visage hide&#39;,\n &#39;  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:&#39;,\n &#39;  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,&#39;,\n &#39;  With all triumphant splendour on my brow,&#39;,\n &#39;  But out alack, he was but one hour mine,&#39;,\n &#39;  The region cloud hath masked him from me now.&#39;,\n &#39;    Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,&#39;,\n &#34;    Suns of the world may stain, when heaven&#39;s sun staineth.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     34&#39;,\n &#39;  Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,&#39;,\n &#39;  And make me travel forth without my cloak,&#39;,\n &#34;  To let base clouds o&#39;ertake me in my way,&#34;,\n &#34;  Hiding thy brav&#39;ry in their rotten smoke?&#34;,\n &#34;  &#39;Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,&#34;,\n &#39;  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,&#39;,\n &#39;  For no man well of such a salve can speak,&#39;,\n &#39;  That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,&#39;,\n &#39;  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,&#39;,\n &#34;  Th&#39; offender&#39;s sorrow lends but weak relief&#34;,\n &#34;  To him that bears the strong offence&#39;s cross.&#34;,\n &#39;    Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,&#39;,\n &#39;    And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     35&#39;,\n &#39;  No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,&#39;,\n &#39;  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,&#39;,\n &#39;  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,&#39;,\n &#39;  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.&#39;,\n &#39;  All men make faults, and even I in this,&#39;,\n &#39;  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,&#39;,\n &#39;  My self corrupting salving thy amiss,&#39;,\n &#39;  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:&#39;,\n &#39;  For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,&#39;,\n &#34;  And &#39;gainst my self a lawful plea commence:&#34;,\n &#39;  Such civil war is in my love and hate,&#39;,\n &#39;    That I an accessary needs must be,&#39;,\n &#39;    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     36&#39;,\n &#39;  Let me confess that we two must be twain,&#39;,\n &#39;  Although our undivided loves are one:&#39;,\n &#39;  So shall those blots that do with me remain,&#39;,\n &#39;  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.&#39;,\n &#39;  In our two loves there is but one respect,&#39;,\n &#39;  Though in our lives a separable spite,&#39;,\n &#34;  Which though it alter not love&#39;s sole effect,&#34;,\n &#34;  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love&#39;s delight.&#34;,\n &#39;  I may not evermore acknowledge thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,&#39;,\n &#39;  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:&#39;,\n &#39;    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,&#39;,\n &#39;    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     37&#39;,\n &#39;  As a decrepit father takes delight,&#39;,\n &#39;  To see his active child do deeds of youth,&#39;,\n &#34;  So I, made lame by Fortune&#39;s dearest spite&#34;,\n &#39;  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.&#39;,\n &#39;  For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or any of these all, or all, or more&#39;,\n &#39;  Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,&#39;,\n &#39;  I make my love engrafted to this store:&#39;,\n &#39;  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,&#39;,\n &#39;  That I in thy abundance am sufficed,&#39;,\n &#39;  And by a part of all thy glory live:&#39;,\n &#39;    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    This wish I have, then ten times happy me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     38&#39;,\n &#39;  How can my muse want subject to invent&#39;,\n &#34;  While thou dost breathe that pour&#39;st into my verse,&#34;,\n &#39;  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,&#39;,\n &#39;  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?&#39;,\n &#39;  O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,&#39;,\n &#39;  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,&#39;,\n &#34;  For who&#39;s so dumb that cannot write to thee,&#34;,\n &#39;  When thou thy self dost give invention light?&#39;,\n &#39;  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth&#39;,\n &#39;  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,&#39;,\n &#39;  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth&#39;,\n &#39;  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.&#39;,\n &#39;    If my slight muse do please these curious days,&#39;,\n &#39;    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     39&#39;,\n &#39;  O how thy worth with manners may I sing,&#39;,\n &#39;  When thou art all the better part of me?&#39;,\n &#39;  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:&#39;,\n &#34;  And what is&#39;t but mine own when I praise thee?&#34;,\n &#39;  Even for this, let us divided live,&#39;,\n &#39;  And our dear love lose name of single one,&#39;,\n &#39;  That by this separation I may give:&#39;,\n &#34;  That due to thee which thou deserv&#39;st alone:&#34;,\n &#39;  O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,&#39;,\n &#39;  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,&#39;,\n &#39;  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.&#39;,\n &#39;    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,&#39;,\n &#39;    By praising him here who doth hence remain.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     40&#39;,\n &#39;  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,&#39;,\n &#39;  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?&#39;,\n &#39;  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,&#39;,\n &#39;  All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,&#39;,\n &#39;  I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,&#39;,\n &#39;  But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest&#39;,\n &#39;  By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.&#39;,\n &#39;  I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief&#39;,\n &#39;  Although thou steal thee all my poverty:&#39;,\n &#39;  And yet love knows it is a greater grief&#39;,\n &#34;  To bear greater wrong, than hate&#39;s known injury.&#34;,\n &#39;    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,&#39;,\n &#39;    Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     41&#39;,\n &#39;  Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,&#39;,\n &#39;  When I am sometime absent from thy heart,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,&#39;,\n &#39;  For still temptation follows where thou art.&#39;,\n &#39;  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,&#39;,\n &#39;  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.&#39;,\n &#34;  And when a woman woos, what woman&#39;s son,&#34;,\n &#39;  Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?&#39;,\n &#39;  Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,&#39;,\n &#39;  And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who lead thee in their riot even there&#39;,\n &#39;  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:&#39;,\n &#39;    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    Thine by thy beauty being false to me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     42&#39;,\n &#39;  That thou hast her it is not all my grief,&#39;,\n &#39;  And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,&#39;,\n &#39;  That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,&#39;,\n &#39;  A loss in love that touches me more nearly.&#39;,\n &#39;  Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,&#39;,\n &#34;  Thou dost love her, because thou know&#39;st I love her,&#34;,\n &#39;  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,&#39;,\n &#34;  Suff&#39;ring my friend for my sake to approve her.&#34;,\n &#34;  If I lose thee, my loss is my love&#39;s gain,&#34;,\n &#39;  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,&#39;,\n &#39;  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,&#39;,\n &#39;  And both for my sake lay on me this cross,&#39;,\n &#34;    But here&#39;s the joy, my friend and I are one,&#34;,\n &#39;    Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     43&#39;,\n &#39;  When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,&#39;,\n &#39;  For all the day they view things unrespected,&#39;,\n &#39;  But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.&#39;,\n &#39;  Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright&#39;,\n &#34;  How would thy shadow&#39;s form, form happy show,&#34;,\n &#39;  To the clear day with thy much clearer light,&#39;,\n &#39;  When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!&#39;,\n &#39;  How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,&#39;,\n &#39;  By looking on thee in the living day,&#39;,\n &#39;  When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,&#39;,\n &#39;  Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!&#39;,\n &#39;    All days are nights to see till I see thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     44&#39;,\n &#39;  If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,&#39;,\n &#39;  Injurious distance should not stop my way,&#39;,\n &#39;  For then despite of space I would be brought,&#39;,\n &#39;  From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,&#39;,\n &#39;  No matter then although my foot did stand&#39;,\n &#39;  Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,&#39;,\n &#39;  As soon as think the place where he would be.&#39;,\n &#39;  But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought&#39;,\n &#39;  To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,&#39;,\n &#39;  But that so much of earth and water wrought,&#39;,\n &#34;  I must attend, time&#39;s leisure with my moan.&#34;,\n &#39;    Receiving nought by elements so slow,&#39;,\n &#34;    But heavy tears, badges of either&#39;s woe.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     45&#39;,\n &#39;  The other two, slight air, and purging fire,&#39;,\n &#39;  Are both with thee, wherever I abide,&#39;,\n &#39;  The first my thought, the other my desire,&#39;,\n &#39;  These present-absent with swift motion slide.&#39;,\n &#39;  For when these quicker elements are gone&#39;,\n &#39;  In tender embassy of love to thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  My life being made of four, with two alone,&#39;,\n &#39;  Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.&#39;,\n &#34;  Until life&#39;s composition be recured,&#34;,\n &#39;  By those swift messengers returned from thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who even but now come back again assured,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.&#39;,\n &#39;    This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,&#39;,\n &#39;    I send them back again and straight grow sad.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     46&#39;,\n &#39;  Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,&#39;,\n &#39;  How to divide the conquest of thy sight,&#39;,\n &#34;  Mine eye, my heart thy picture&#39;s sight would bar,&#34;,\n &#39;  My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,&#39;,\n &#39;  My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,&#39;,\n &#39;  (A closet never pierced with crystal eyes)&#39;,\n &#39;  But the defendant doth that plea deny,&#39;,\n &#39;  And says in him thy fair appearance lies.&#39;,\n &#39;  To side this title is impanelled&#39;,\n &#39;  A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,&#39;,\n &#39;  And by their verdict is determined&#39;,\n &#34;  The clear eye&#39;s moiety, and the dear heart&#39;s part.&#34;,\n &#34;    As thus, mine eye&#39;s due is thy outward part,&#34;,\n &#34;    And my heart&#39;s right, thy inward love of heart.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     47&#39;,\n &#39;  Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,&#39;,\n &#39;  And each doth good turns now unto the other,&#39;,\n &#39;  When that mine eye is famished for a look,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;&#39;,\n &#34;  With my love&#39;s picture then my eye doth feast,&#34;,\n &#39;  And to the painted banquet bids my heart:&#39;,\n &#34;  Another time mine eye is my heart&#39;s guest,&#34;,\n &#39;  And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.&#39;,\n &#39;  So either by thy picture or my love,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy self away, art present still with me,&#39;,\n &#39;  For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,&#39;,\n &#39;  And I am still with them, and they with thee.&#39;,\n &#39;    Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight&#39;,\n &#34;    Awakes my heart, to heart&#39;s and eye&#39;s delight.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     48&#39;,\n &#39;  How careful was I when I took my way,&#39;,\n &#39;  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,&#39;,\n &#39;  That to my use it might unused stay&#39;,\n &#39;  From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!&#39;,\n &#39;  But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,&#39;,\n &#39;  Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,&#39;,\n &#39;  Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.&#39;,\n &#39;  Thee have I not locked up in any chest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,&#39;,\n &#39;  Within the gentle closure of my breast,&#39;,\n &#39;  From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,&#39;,\n &#34;    And even thence thou wilt be stol&#39;n I fear,&#34;,\n &#39;    For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     49&#39;,\n &#39;  Against that time (if ever that time come)&#39;,\n &#39;  When I shall see thee frown on my defects,&#39;,\n &#39;  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,&#39;,\n
